# Udemy-website

I created a Udemy-style online learning website using HTML and CSS. This website serves as a front-end template for an e-learning platform where users can browse, explore, and enroll in various online courses. The design includes a homepage with featured courses, category sections, instructor highlights, and a responsive layout for both desktop and mobile devices.

The goal of the project was to design a clean, user-friendly interface that mimics the structure of popular learning platforms. While this version is static (HTML/CSS only), it sets the foundation for future development, such as integrating JavaScript for interactivity and backend functionality for course management, user accounts, and payment systems.
